# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Pin the composite Action Python setup to the immutable v7.0.0 commit.
- Exact-match rate now measures the fraction of matching run pairs. The
  composite score and CLI threshold no longer change when the same outputs
  arrive in a different order. This changes scores for partially matching
  batches; recalibrate any existing thresholds when upgrading to 0.3.0.
- Document the live eval-output handoff for the GitHub Action and recommend
  short canonical answers for lexical stability checks.

### Added
- A composite GitHub Action that runs the documented convergence scorer on a
  JSON run set and exposes the reported lexical scores.

### Changed
- README install section now uses `python -m pip install agent-convergence-scorer`
  and documents `agent-convergence-scorer --version` as a one-line install
  readback before the Quick start example.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-05

### Added
- `receipt` CLI adapter for Hermes-shaped parallel agent results. It emits a
  separately versioned, machine-readable lexical convergence receipt with only
  `review` or `investigate` decisions and `acceptance_authority: false`.
- Checked-in three-agent fixture demonstrating the post-run receipt contract.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-08-08

### Added
- Optional `--min-convergence FLOAT` CLI gate. It compares the reported
  `convergence_score` to an inclusive finite threshold in `[0, 1]`, emits a
  machine-readable result, and exits `3` when the threshold is not met.

### Changed
- `score_runs([])` now raises `ValueError` instead of reporting perfect
  convergence.
- Jaccard overlap treats two empty token sets as identical (`1.0`).

### Changed
- Added a package metadata link to the project documentation.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-31

GitHub-only metadata release. Not published to PyPI — there is no
`agent-convergence-scorer==0.1.1` package; the next PyPI release is `0.1.2`.

### Added
- `.zenodo.json` and `CITATION.cff` for citable, archivable releases with a DOI.

### Changed
- README identity cleanup for consistent Hermes Labs attribution.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-22

Initial public release.

### Added
- `score_runs(runs)` — compute all four metrics in one call
- `exact_match_rate(runs)` — fraction of runs identical to `runs[0]`, range `[0, 1]`
- `token_overlap(runs)` — pairwise Jaccard over whitespace tokens
- `divergence_point(runs)` — first token position where runs disagree
- `convergence_score(runs)` — composite 0-1 score, weights `0.5 * exact_match + 0.3 * avg_token_overlap + 0.2 * normalized_divergence_distance`
- `agent-convergence-scorer` CLI — reads JSON from file or stdin, emits JSON results
- Stdin input support via `-` argument
- Stdlib-only — no runtime dependencies
- Python 3.9+ support

### Origin
Extracted and hardened from a prototype built during the Hermes Labs
Cascade Hackathon (2026-04-22), a controlled experiment measuring whether
prompt framing affects ideation convergence across N concurrent agents.
The scorer provided the method by which that experiment measured collapse.
